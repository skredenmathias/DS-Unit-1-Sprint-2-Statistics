## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?

top LCS / LEC / intl teams over time

## Misconceptions

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What stats are the most important for a team (G2) to be successful?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Differences in playstyle in the different regions

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/ - I really want feedback about this source & the difficulty of using the data.
Riot also has an API I can use, but that's for non-professional play. Would also like feedback on feasability. https://developer.riotgames.com/
This is also a possible source for non-pro play, but not as interesting. https://www.kaggle.com/chuckephron/leagueoflegends
